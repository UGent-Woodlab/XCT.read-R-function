This is the repository for the XCT.Read R-function. This function was created to easily read and calculate ring width and density parameters using the txt-formatted ring indications and density profile output from the MATLAB-based [RingIndicator software](https://dendrochronomics.ugent.be/), created at UGent-Woodlab. The section of the profile where a density parameter is calculated can be set by the user: either a fraction of the ring (e.g. the second quarter of each ring) or a fixed width (e.g. the last 100 Âµm of each ring). The output of the function is a dplR or a long format data frame.

## Getting started

Before running the function, ensure that you have the following packages installed and loaded:
library("tidyverse")
library("dplR")
dplR is not used within the function itself but is needed to process the output which can be set to dplR dataframe.
