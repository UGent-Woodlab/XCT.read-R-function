This is the repository for the XCT.Read R-function. This function was created to easily read and calculate ring width and density parameters using the txt-formatted ring indications and density profile output from the MATLAB-based [RingIndicator software](https://github.com/UGent-Woodlab/XCT-toolchain-compiled), created at UGent-Woodlab (more info on our [website](https://dendrochronomics.ugent.be/) and in [this paper](todo)). The section of the profile where a density parameter is calculated can be set by the user: either a fraction of the ring (e.g. the second quarter of each ring) or a fixed width (e.g. the last 100 Âµm of each ring). The output of the function is a dplR or a long format data frame.

##  Function: XCT.Read.R
XCT.Read function reads and calculates ring width and density parameters from txt-formatted ring indications and density profile output. The parameters are: 
- path: A path to the folder containing the txt files. 
- output: The output type, can be "ringwidth" (dplR format of ring width), "density" (dplR format of density parameter), "ringwidth_density" (long format of the sample, year, ring width, and density), or "density_profile" (long format of the sample, year, and density profile in that year)
- densityType: The type of density to calculate, can be "fraction" or "fixed". "fraction" calculates the density in a variable width window that corresponds to two fraction numbers that go from 0 (start ring) to 1 (end ring), set in variable area. "fixed" calculates the density in a fixed width window, starting from the beginning or the end of the ring. set in variable area.
- area: Fraction of the ring to calculate the density parameter. If densityType = "fraction" this is a vector of two numbers that go from 0 (start ring) to 1 (end ring). If densityType = "fixed" this is a vector with "start" or "end" as the first variable, and the width of the window in micrometers as the second variable.
- fun: The function to calculate the density in the selected area, can be "mean", "median", "min", "max", or "mean_top_x". "mean_top_x" calculates the mean of the x highest values in the selected area, the variable x should be set to a fraction between 0 and 1.
- x: Fraction of the highest values to calculate the mean. Only used if fun = "mean_top_x".
- removeNarrowRings: Removes density parameters of rings that are too small, set in minRingWidth. Can be either TRUE or FALSE.
- minRingWidth: Minimum width of the ring in mm that should be used in density calculations, only if removeNarrowRings = TRUE.

## Example use: XCT.Read.Rmd
An example R Markdown file that showcases the different possible outputs and calculations. 

---

## Test data folder
Some example txt indication files.

## Getting started

Before running the function, ensure that you have the following packages installed and loaded:
- library("tidyverse")
- library("dplR")

dplR is not used within the function itself but is needed to process the output which can be set to dplR dataframe.
